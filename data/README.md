This is a sample dataset taking from fMRI recordings from human V1 and V2. 

A PCA is performed on an independent dataset to reduce the dimensionality down to 10 in each ROI.

A total of 1560 trials are available.

    data_node1_val (1560x10) is the data in V1

    data_node1_val (1560x10) is the data in V2
    
    labels (1560x1) is the condition of each single trial, corresponding to 120 different images
