# MCPA
multi-connection pattern analysis

MATLAB code used for Yuanning Li, R. Mark Richardson, and Avniel Singh Ghuman. Multi-Connection Pattern Analysis: decoding the representational content of neural communication. (submitted, in revision) (preprint doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.1101/046441)

    mcpa.m file contains the main function for training and testing MCPA model

    example.m is a script that demonstrate the application of MCPA on a real dataset to evaluate 
    single trial classification accuracy of individual natural images, based on the pattern of 
    functional connectivity between neural activity in V1 and V2.

    /data contains the corresponding sample dataset used in example.m

    /util contains some help functions
