multi-connection pattern analysis

MATLAB code used for Yuanning Li, R. Mark Richardson, and Avniel Singh Ghuman. Multi-Connection Pattern Analysis: decoding the representational content of neural communication. (submitted, in revision) (preprint doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.1101/046441)

mcpa.m file contains the main function for training and testing MCPA model

example.m is a script that demonstrate the application of MCPA on a real dataset to evaluate single trial classification accuracy of individual natural images, based on the pattern of functional connectivity between neural activity in V1 and V2.

/data contains a sample dataset based on fMRI data in V1 and V2
/util contains some help functions
